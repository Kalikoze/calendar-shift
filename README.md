# Calendar Shift

A little script that downloads the current Turing calendars in their iCalendar format and spits out new calendars with those events shifted into the future.

## Usage

```rb
$ bundle
$ bundle exec ruby scheduler.rb
```

When prompted, enter the Start and End dates for the module you want to copy.

In pretty much every case, the start date would be the **first Monday** of the previous module and the end date would be the **last Friday** of the previous module.
You can also enter a custom offset, but in most cases you will want 7 (6 week module + 1 week intermission). If it is a double intermission, you would enter 8.

The process should look like this:

```
worace @ calendar-shift âž¸  bundle exec ruby scheduler.rb
Enter start date -- probably the first day of the last module:
<YYYY-MM-DD> (e.g. 2015-11-02)> 2016-05-09
Enter end date -- probably the last day of the last module:
<YYYY-MM-DD> (e.g. 2015-11-02)> 2016-06-17
Enter offset in # weeks:
(default: 7)>
```


### Adding a new calendar to the collection

From time to time you may decide you need to add a new calendar to the list that get scraped by the script. To do this, you need to add the new public (HTML) address for the calendar to the `CALENDARS` to the [calendar_collection.rb](https://github.com/turingschool/calendar-shift/blob/master/lib/calendar_collection.rb) file.


The address will look something like this `casimircreative.com_59k8msrrc2ddhcv787vubvp0s4@group.calendar.google.com`.

You can find it by going into the "Calendar Settings" menu on Google Calendar and scrolling down to the "Calendar Address" section and copying the "Calendar ID".

### Importing the calendar to Google Calendar

Under the settings option in google calendar, there is a tab "calendars". Upon clicking that and scrolling down, there will be an "import calendar" link. Click that link, find the file to import and choose the correct calendar to append to. It should import!
